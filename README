This repo is for using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and chef-solo/Librarian to spin up a postgresql/postgis VM while on a Windows host, because running an entire new computer inside of the host computer is easier than setting up any dev environment on Windows. :'(

Steps 1-4 are skippable if you have the dependencies installed.

1. Install chefdk & add it to your path. https://download.chef.io/chef-dk/
2. Install virtualbox. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Install vagrant. https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/
4. Install Librarian: 'gem install librarian-chef' (requires Ruby; get that here if you don't have it yet --> https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ )
4.5 Make sure all of this crap is on your path
5. cd into the directory where this is installed.
6. 'vagrant up'
7. 'vagrant ssh'
8. 'sudo su - postgres' (from the postgresql vagrant development wiki -- will try to eliminate this step through Chef later on)
9. 'psql' to enter postgresql command line!

Congratulations on escaping from Windows.
