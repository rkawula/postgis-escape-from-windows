This repo is for using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and chef-solo/Librarian to spin up a postgresql/postgis VM while on a Windows host, because running an entire new computer inside of the host computer is easier than setting up any dev environment on Windows. :'(

Steps 1-4 are skippable if you have the dependencies installed.

1. Install chefdk & add it to your path.
2. Install virtualbox.
3. Install vagrant.
4. Install Librarian: 'gem install librarian-chef'
5. cd into the directory where this is installed.
6. 'vagrant up'
7. 'vagrant ssh'
8. 'sudo su - postgres' (from the postgresql vagrant development wiki -- will try to eliminate this step through Chef later on)
9. 'psql' to enter postgresql command line!

Congratulations on escaping from Windows.
